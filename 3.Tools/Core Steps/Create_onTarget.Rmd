This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
<!-- Here, we preprocess secondary screen input files and create objects from the onTarget object. -->
```{r}
secondary=read.csv('/Users/sinhas8/Project_OffTarget/secondary-screen-dose-response-curve-parameters.csv')
onTarget$secondary_prism
secondary[,c(21, 20, 11)]
colnames(secondary)
dim(onTarget$drugCategory)
```

```{r}
secondary=read.csv('secondary-screen-dose-response-curve-parameters.csv')
secondary$col_names=paste(secondary$broad_id, secondary$screen_id, secondary$name, secondary$phase, sep='_')
secondary_trimmed=secondary[,c(21, 20, 9)]
secondary_trimmed_wide <- spread(secondary_trimmed, col_names, auc)
rownames(secondary_trimmed_wide)=as.character(secondary_trimmed_wide$row_name)
secondary_trimmed_wide=secondary_trimmed_wide[,-1]
column_annotation=t(sapply(colnames(secondary_trimmed_wide), function(x) c(strsplit(x, '_')[[1]])))
column_annotation=data.frame(column_annotation)
colnames(column_annotation)=c('Broad_id', 'Screen_id', 'CommonName')
rownames(column_annotation)=NULL
column_annotation$Broad_id_trimmed=sapply(as.character(column_annotation$Broad_id), function(x) strsplit(x, '-')[[1]][2])
secondary_trimmed_wide_t=t(secondary_trimmed_wide)
rownames(secondary_trimmed_wide_t)=column_annotation$Broad_id_trimmed
secondary_trimmed_wide_t
'secondary_trimmed_wide_t' is your auc matrix

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
