<!-- Test the effect of SLCs and ABC transporters -->
```{r}
ABCB1_id=which(rownames(drugVScrispr_corr_Strength)=='ABCB1')
ACBC1_rank=apply(drugVScrispr_corr_Strength, 2, function(x) x[ABCB1_id])
hist(ACBC1_rank)
```

<!-- Based on these results, we conclude that ion channels are not a major driver of response -->
