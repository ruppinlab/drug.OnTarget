This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
<!-- Test the effect of SLCs and ABC transporters -->
```{r}
ABCB1_id=which(rownames(drugVScrispr_corr_Strength)=='ABCB1')
ACBC1_rank=apply(drugVScrispr_corr_Strength, 2, function(x) x[ABCB1_id])
hist(ACBC1_rank)
```

<!-- Based on these results, we conclude that ion channels are not a major driver of response -->

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
